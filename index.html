                Hello, my name is Daniel Yevtushenko and I am currently attending my first year of Computer Programming
                at Georgian College. I have been tinkering with computers ever since I was a kid both hardware and
                software wise but it's one of those things where even though i've sunk thousands of hours into learning
                how they work and writing code and building computers I'm not quite good at any of it. Doesn't stop me
                from working on it though.
            </p>

                <li>Automating processes that one wouldn't normally automate</li>
                <li>Those sugar cookies they sell at Walmart that give you diabetes as soon as you bite into them but
                    why are they so good</li>
